*****************
* ! IMPORTANT ! *
*****************

If you have used the previous version of the Enhanced Selection datatype,
you need to do a bit more if you want to completely switch to this new version.

The two version are not directly compatible and that is why they have a different
datatype identifier. The 'updateenhancedselection.php' provided in the bin/php
folder will take care of the update process. Run it from the root of the eZ Publish
installation to make the switch.
